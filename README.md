# Enhancing Pulsar Candidate Identification with a Self-Tuning Pseudo-Labeling Semi-Supervised Learning
In this paper, we utilize semi-supervised learning combined with generative models to identify pulsar candidates. The scripts train_vqvae.py, train_GPT.py, and sample_VQVAE_GPT.py are employed for the generation of pulsar data. The main executable, Multimodel_Semi.py, orchestrates the process and can be run directly for the entire pipeline.
