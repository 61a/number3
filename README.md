In this paper, we utilize semi-supervised learning combined with generative models to identify pulsar candidates. The scripts train_vqvae.py, train_GPT.py, and sample_VQVAE_GPT are employed for the generation of pulsar data. The main executable, Multimodel_Semi.py, orchestrates the process and can be run directly for the entire pipeline.
