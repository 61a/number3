# Number 3
In this study, we employ semi-supervised learning techniques in conjunction with a production-grade model to identify pulsar candidates. The generation of pulsar data is facilitated by the scripts train_vqvae.py, train_GPT.py, and sample_VQVAE_GPT.py. The main executable, Multimodel_Semi.py, orchestrates the process and can be run directly for the entire pipeline.
