# Enhancing Pulsar Candidate Identification with a Self-Tuning Pseudo-Labeling Semi-Supervised Learning
In this paper, we implement semi-supervised learning combined with generative models for the identification of pulsar candidates. The scripts train_vqvae.py, train_GPT.py, and sample_VQVAE_GPT are used for generating pulsar data. The main executable, Multimodel_Semi.py, integrates the workflow and can be directly run, provided that the necessary data preprocessing has been completed in advance.
